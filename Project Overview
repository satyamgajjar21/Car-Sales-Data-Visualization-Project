Car Sales Data Visualization Project
This repository showcases my work in utilizing Excel for the Web to create key visualizations for analyzing car sales and profits. Through this project, I performed data analysis and developed insightful visualizations to help a regional manager of a car dealership chain understand sales and profitability trends across dealers.

Project Overview
In this project, I:

Utilized Excel for the Web to create professional visualizations.
Analyzed car sales and profit data using pivot tables and charts.
Customized charts and formatting to highlight key performance insights.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a modified subset of the IBM Accelerator Catalog dataset. For this work, I exclusively used the provided dataset to ensure alignment with the project goals.

Visualization Tasks and Execution
Task 1: Quantity Sold by Dealer ID
Created a bar chart to visualize the quantity sold by each dealer.
Sorted the data in descending order for clarity.
Updated the chart title to Quantity Sold by Dealer ID.
Task 2: Profit by Date and Model
Developed a line chart to track profits by date and model.
Customized the chart title to Profit by Date and Model.
Task 3: Profit by Year and Dealer ID
Built a column chart to visualize profits by year and dealer ID.
Applied a red fill color to the data columns for better visualization.
Updated the chart title to Profit by Year and Dealer ID.
Task 4: Sum of Profits for Hudson Model Cars by Dealer ID
Created a line chart to showcase profits for Hudson models by dealer ID.
Customized the chart by:
Removing horizontal gridlines.
Placing the legend on the right side of the chart.
Coloring the series outline in green.
Updated the chart title to Profit of Hudson Models by Dealer ID.
Task 5: Saved Final Workbook
Saved the completed workbook as CarSalesByModelEnd.xlsx.
Key Outcomes
By completing this project, I:

Gained hands-on experience creating and customizing data visualizations in Excel for the Web.
Analyzed key performance metrics (KPIs) such as sales quantity and profitability trends.
Developed a comprehensive understanding of using pivot tables and charts to drive data-driven insights.
This repository reflects my ability to independently utilize Excel tools to analyze and visualize data effectively for real-world applications.
